# Bing Fluent Design Skin

This repository contains a custom CSS skin for Bing that matches Microsoft Fluent Design better than the original Bing website. It applies various styles and effects to make Bing look more modern and consistent with other Microsoft products.

## How to use it

To use this skin, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to inject custom CSS code into web pages. Some examples are:

- Custom Style Script for Microsoft Edge
- Stylus for Chrome, Firefox and Opera
- Stylish for Chrome and Firefox

After installing the extension, create a new style for Bing and paste the CSS code from this repository. Save the style and reload Bing to see the changes.

## Features

This skin modifies the following elements of Bing:

- The header bar with the search box and menu items
