# Bing Fluent Design Skin

This repository contains a custom CSS skin for Bing that matches Microsoft Fluent Design better than the original Bing website. It applies various styles and effects to make Bing look more modern and consistent with other Microsoft products. It follows the WinUI guidelines for Windows 11.

## New Bing background

Additionally, you can use the New Bing Background CSS skin if you're willing to try a page background that resembles the one in Bing Chat along with the skin. Both CSS skins should integrate perfectly fine.

## How to use it

To use this skin, you need to install a browser extension that allows you to inject custom CSS code into web pages. Some examples are:

- Custom Style Script for Microsoft Edge (ex. Stylus, Amino)
- Stylus for Chrome, Firefox and Opera
- Stylish for Chrome and Firefox

Also, if you want the Bing Chat background, follow this link: https://userstyles.world/style/9837/new-bing-background

After installing the extension, create a new style for Bing and paste the contents from bingfluentskin.css (or bingfluentskin-stylus.css if you use Stylus) from this repository. Save the style and reload Bing to see the changes.

## Features

This skin modifies the following elements of Bing:

- The header bar with the search box and menu items
- The scope bar with different search categories
- The font, and font weights of the website (Updated to Segoe UI Variable if font is installed, and Bold text is changed to Semibold for consistency)

Some of the effects applied by this skin are:

- Rounded corners and borders
- Blur and transparency effects
